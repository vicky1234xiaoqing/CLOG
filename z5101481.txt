Week Diary of Chunxiao Tang ( z5101481)

Week 1
Group formed. We discussed about the allocated of tasks. My task is developing the backend of project , include database and a python http server. And I create the jira and github accounts.

Week 2
I create app.py and use flask as the python server framework. I will build a RESTFul API for the front end developer and call Machine Learning module to calculate.

Week 3

Disscussed with Jia Chen and develop the RESTFul API, provide some demo data.

Week 6
We re-start this project and I combined rear-end with frontend. 

Week 7

I design the Databases for our project and set it up in my computer. Also, I have finished the urls for our website.

Week 8

I create the POST method and json method for data which is sent between rear and front. That's really usefull. We can figure the data problem.

Week 9

I store the data in MySQL. But there is something wrong for data displayed in the front end. So I write some js and help my teammate to confirm the data type and structure.

Week 10

There are some pages that are wrong in sometimes. We figure it. Beacuse the Database doesn't have the data we need. I write the API for check data.
